    "For spectral differentiation of a grid function $v$, we follow the model of the last chapter exactly. First we need a band-limited interpolant of $v$, which we obtain by evaluating the inverse DFT (3.3) for all $x$ rather than just $x$ on the grid. But before we differentiate our interpolant, there is a complication to address, suggested in Figure 3.1. Evaluating the inverse transform (3.3) as it stands would give a term $e^{iNx/2}$ with derivative $(iN/2)e^{iNx/2}$ . Since $e^{iNx/2}$ represents a real, sawtooth wave on the grid, its derivative should be zero at the grid points, not a complex exponential! The problem is that (3.3) treats the highest wavenumber asymmetrically. We can fix this by defining $\\hat{v}_{-N/2} = \\hat{v}_{N/2}$ and replacing (3.3) by\n",
